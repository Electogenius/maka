Truly international programming language

```gherkin
English
# says hello world forever
this is "the start"
	put text "Hello, world" in this box
	move to the next box.
	move to previous box
	say what is in box.
If there is something in this box, go to "the start"
```
## features:
- turing-complete
- only a few, verbose/flexible commands (to make it easy to use/read)
- tape (can be described as an infinite array of boxes which store values)
- 2 basic data types (text/number)
- goto statements


also would be nice if you could help translate it into more languages/improve translations/suggest more functions

## todo:
- [x] setup
[60%] commands
- [ ] add languages
